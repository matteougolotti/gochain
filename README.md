A simple blockchain application for learning purposes.
Implements a P2P node controlled by a HTTP interface and comminicating with other nodes through a WebSocket API.
All the nodes maintain a synchronized blockchain, however no security / POW / POS algorithm is implemented, as the application is for demonstration only.
